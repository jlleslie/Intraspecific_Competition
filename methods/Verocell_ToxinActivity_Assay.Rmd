#Vero Cell Toxin Activity Assay 
## Modified from a protocol written by [Cassie Schumacher] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassie-schumacher-2542595)

###Day 1 Seeding Cells

#### Harvest cells
1. Preheat media in 37°C water bath
	* [DMEM] (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/11965092) supplemented with 10% [FBS] (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10438026) & 1% [Pen/Strep] (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15140122)
	* [0.25% Trypsin-EDTA] (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/25200056)
2. Removed old DMEM from  the T‐75 flask 
3. Wash the flask with sterile [PBS](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10010023), remove.
3. Add 1-2mL trypsin to the flask. Let sit on bench until cells begin to come off (this is visible to naked eye).
4. Hit sides of flasks to loosen cells. 
5. Add 4mL supplemented DMEM and wash cells off the back of the flask, move the cells into a sterile conical.
5. Spin 5min @ 1000 RPM @ 25°C (room temp).
5. Decant supernatant.
6. Resuspend the cells in 3mL of fresh supplemented DMEM
	+ As a rule you need 3mL fresh media per 

#### Count cells
1.	Add 100uL cell suspension to 100uL [trypan blue](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15250061).
2.	Add 10uL of this mixture to each chamber of a hemocytometer.
3. Count the number of viable cells (not blue) in the corners of the hemocytometer hi-lighted in yellow, remember to count cells on the line for the top and right sides of the square only

4.	Average number of viable cells
5.	Multiply by dilution factor 
	+ dilution factor is 2 since 100uL cells was added to 100uL trypan (for a total volume of 200uL)
6.	Multiply by correction factor to give cells/mL, the correction factor for the part we count is always 10^4
7.	Multiply by total volume to give total number of cells

#### Re-suspend cells to desired concentration and seed plate 
1. The concentration of cells in each well will be 10^5 cells/0.09mL 
2. Determine how many wells you need  to complete your assay (ideally you would have done this before so you have enough cells)
	+ we usually run each sample in duplicate with anti-toxin antibody controls for a total of 24 wells/sample
3.	Determine how much to dilute your cells by 
 	+ Add in extra to account for pipetting error!
 	
 	     Formula for determining how much to dilute your cell stock: 
 		 x (mL of stock cells from step 6 of Harvest cells) = (number of cells/mL) / (10^5 cells/0.09mL) * # mL required to complete the assay 
         For example: If you are running one 96-well plate, you would need  100mL of cells at a concentration of 10^5 cells/0.09mL 
        if the the concentration of the cells you harvested from your flask are 1.7x10^6 cells/mL then you would need to add 
 	
 	
3.	Dilute cells in DMEM to get the number of mL required 


###Day 2 Adding Sample to Cells 

### Dilute intestinal content 
1)	Find the content weight (8)
2)	Convert grams to mg to uL (9)
3)	Find total number of uL solution needed (10)
4)	Find total amount of PBS to add (11):
5)	Add uL PBS to cecal content. Vortex and spin.
6)	Sterilize content /PBS into an eppendorf tube by putting content in syringe and passing through 0.22um filter. Place on ice
**This is the 10-­‐1 stock that is used with the dilution plate.**

Create Dilution plate #1 (DP#1)
1)	One lane for each sample; 6 wells
2)	One lane for the positive control; 6 wells
3)	Label wells with their dilutions (10-­‐1  to 10-­‐6)
4)	Add appropriate amount of PBS to each well
*no PBS to 10-­‐1  wells for samples
*900uL PBS to 10-­‐2  to 10-­‐6  samples
*90uL PBS to 10-­‐1  well for positive control
5)	Add appropriate amount of sample to each well
*100uL 10-­‐1  sample  stock to 10-­‐1  wells
*10uL 10-­‐1  sample  stock to  10-­‐2  wells; etc
*10uL positive control stock to 10-­‐1  positive control well
*10uL from 10-­‐1  positive control well to 10-­‐2  positive control well; etc.
6)	Place dilution on ice.

Create Dilution plate #2 (DP#2)
1)	Need 2 lanes of 6 wells each for each sample.
*12 wells
2)	Label all wells with their dilution (10-­‐1  to 10-­‐6)
3)	Alternate rows are used for samples and anti-­‐toxins.
4)	Label wells with correct amount of stock solution and PBS.
*20uL diluted toxin (from DP#1), 20uL PBS for 'sample' rows
*20uL diluted toxin (from DP#1), 20uL anti-­‐toxin for 'anti-­‐toxin' rows
6)	Calculate how much anti-­‐toxin is needed (12)
7)	Add 20uL PBS to all 'sample' rows.
Add 20uL anti-­‐toxin to all 'anti-­‐toxin 'rows
8)	Transfer 20uL from appropriate sample/wells on DP#1 to appropriate wells  on DP#2.
**ALLOW 40 MIN INCUBATION SO ANTI-­‐TOXIN CAN BIND/INACTIVATE TOXIN**
9)	Add 10uL of mixture from DP#2 to appropriate Vero cell wells.
10)	Incubate Vero cells at 37°C overnight.

Analyze Vero cells using the light microscope
1)	Remember, the dilution factor changes by a factor of 10 when added to Vero cells (10-­‐3  -­‐> 10-­‐4)
2)	Anti-­‐toxin wells should show little to no cell rounding.
3)	Sample wells: Choose well that is last to have 100% cell rounding.
4)	Positive control: Choose well that is 100% cell rounding (in theory, should be least diluted)
5)	Cell rounding: log [final dilution factor]/ per gram of cecal content.
*use reciprocal of final dilution factor: ex/ 10-­‐5   -­‐>  105  = log[105] = 5
