## Modified from a protocol written by [Cassie Schumacher] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassie-schumacher-2542595)

###Day 1 Seeding Cells
### Splitting cells
1. Preheat media in 37°C water bath
	* DMEM (w/ 10%FBS & 1% Pen/Strep)
	* 0.25% Trypsin-­‐EDTA
2. Decant media from T-­‐75 into waste.
3. Add 1mL Trypsin to flask. Let sit on bench until cells begin to come off (this is visible to naked eye).
4.	Hit sides of flasks to loosen cells. Add 4mL DMEM and wash cells off the back of the flask. Add mixture to 15mL conical. Spin 5min @ 1000 RPM @ 25°C
5. Decant supernatant.
6. Resuspend the cells in 3mL DMEM
