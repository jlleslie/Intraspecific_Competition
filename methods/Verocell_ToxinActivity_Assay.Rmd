## Modified from a protocol written by [Cassie Schumacher] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassie-schumacher-2542595)

###Day 1 : Part 1 Preparing the Cells

#### Harvest cells
1. Preheat media in 37°C water bath
	* [DMEM] (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/11965092) supplemented with 10% [FBS] (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10438026) & 1% [Pen/Strep] (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15140122)
	* [0.25% Trypsin-EDTA] (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/25200056)
2. Removed old DMEM from  the T‐75 flask  of [Vero cells] (https://www.google.com/search?q=atcc+vero+cells&oq=ATCC+Vero+cells&aqs=chrome.0.0l5.4030j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=atcc+ccl-81)
3. Wash the flask with sterile [PBS](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10010023), remove.
3. Add 1-2mL trypsin to the flask. Let sit on bench until cells begin to come off (this is visible to naked eye).
4. Hit sides of flasks to loosen cells. 
5. Add 4mL supplemented DMEM and wash cells off the back of the flask, move the cells into a sterile conical.
5. Spin 5min @ 1000 RPM @ 25°C (room temp).
5. Decant supernatant.
6. Resuspend the cells in 3mL of fresh supplemented DMEM
	+ As a rule you need 3mL fresh media per 

#### Count cells
1.	Add 100uL cell suspension to 100uL [trypan blue](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15250061).
2.	Add 10uL of this mixture to each chamber of a hemocytometer.
3. Count the number of viable cells (not blue) in the corners of the hemocytometer hi-lighted in yellow, remember to count cells on the line for the top and right sides of the square only

4.	Average number of viable cells
5.	Multiply by dilution factor 
	+ dilution factor is 2 since 100uL cells was added to 100uL trypan (for a total volume of 200uL)
6.	Multiply by correction factor to give cells/mL, the correction factor for the part we count is always 10^4
7.	Multiply by total volume to give total number of cells

#### Re-suspend cells to desired concentration and seed plate 
1. The concentration of cells in each well will be 10^5 cells/0.09mL 
2. Determine how many wells you need  to complete your assay (ideally you would have done this before so you have enough cells)
	+ we usually run each sample in duplicate with anti-toxin antibody controls for a total of 24 wells/sample
3. Determine how much to dilute your cells by 
 	+ Add in extra to account for pipetting error! 
 
	```
		Formula to determine how much to dilute your cell stock:     
		x (mL of stock cells from step 6 of Harvest cells) = (number of cells/mL) / (10^5 cells/0.09mL) * # mL required to complete the assay 
		For example: If you are running one 96-well plate, you would need  100mL of cells at a concentration of 10^5 cells/0.09mL 
		if the the concentration of the cells you harvested from your flask is 1.7x10^6 cells/mL 
		Then you would add 6.5mL of your stock of cells into 3.5 mL of supplemented DMEM 
 	```
4. Dilute cells in supplemented DMEM to get the number of mL required 
5. Add 90uL of the correctly diluted cells to each well of a sterile cell culture treated plate
6.  Place plates in a 37C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator
	+ The cells need to incubated on the plate for at least 4 hours to allow cells to stick to the plate  

###Day 1 : Part 2 Preparing the Samples  

#### Dilute intestinal content and filter sterilize  
1.	Find the content weight (subtract the weight of empty tube from weight of full tube ) 
2.	Convert from grams to mg to uL (using the admittedly flawed assumption that 1g=1mL)
3.  Dilute content 1:10 using sterile PBS based on the weight of the sample (i.e. weight/volume)
4. 	Vortex to homogenize the sample in PBS
5. spin for 5 min at 13,000 rpm at room temperature
	+ This pellets the solid part of the content 
6. Load 160uL of the supernatant into a [MultiScreenHTS GV Filter Plate, 0.22 µm, clear, sterile] (https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/MultiScreenHTS-GV-Filter-Plate,-0.22%C2%A0%C2%B5m,-clear,-sterile,MM_NF-MSGVS2210)
	+ Alternatively you can sterilize diluted content  into an eppendorf tube by putting content in syringe and passing through 0.22um filter. 
	+ This is the 10^‐1 stock that is used with the dilution plate.

####Create Dilution plate #1 (this plate will be all of the serial dilutions needed for each sample) 
1. Use a sterile 96-well plate
2. Load 100uL of each filter sterilized sample in wells 1 or 7 in rows A-H, include pure toxin or culture supernatant as a postive control and PBS as a negative control 
3. Add 90uL of PBS to the rest of the wells on the plate
4. Make 1:10 serial dilutions across the plate (see plate map bellow)

####Create Dilution plate #2 (this plate is for the addition of  anti-toxin Ab to the sample)
1. Label all wells with their dilution (10^‐1  to 10^‐6)
  	+  Need 2 lanes of 6 wells each for each sample.
2.  Remove an aliquot of [Alere's goat anti-toxin A&B sera] (https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-c-difficile-toxin-antitoxin-kit-c-difficile-toxin-antitoxin-kit/23046761) from the -20C.
	+  Dilute the sera 1:25 in sterile PBS 
3.	Alternate rows on the plate are  loaded with PBS or anti-toxin antibodies 
	+ In rows A, C, E, and G add 20uL of PBS  across all wells
	+ In rows B, D, F, and H add 20uL of diluted anti-toxin sera 
4. Transfer 20uL from appropriate sample/wells on dilution plate 1 to appropriate wells on this plate  (this is a further 1:2 dilution)
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10421686/17569686/5c28996a-5f17-11e6-9b92-11ff5c4e28ae.jpg" width="500" height="300" /></div> 
5. Once all samples have been added incubate for 40 min so anti-toxin antibodies in sera can bind/inactivate the toxin. 
6. Add 10uL of mixture from  dilution plate 2 to wells of Vero cells (this is a further 1/10 dilution).
7. Incubate cells at 37C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator over night.

###Day 2:  Reading the Plate 

####Analyze Vero cells using the light microscope
1.	Remember, the dilution factor changes by a factor of 10 when added to Vero cells (10^‐3  -­‐> 10^‐4)
2.	Anti-toxin wells should show no cell rounding.
3.	Sample wells: Choose well that is last well to have >= 80% cell rounding & use the dilution of this well to calculate  toxin activity 
4.	Positive control: Wells with higher concentrations of toxin  diluted in PBS should be round while the counterpart wells added to the anti-toxin sera should have no rounding. 
	+ This allows you to know that any cell rounding is due to the toxin and not other things in the sample 
5. 	Toxin activity:  log [reciprocal of the final dilution factor]/ per gram of cecal content.

	```
		Toxin activity calculation: 
		Say the last well with 80% or more of the cells round  for mouse #1 was A4 and A10 (see plate maps above).
		This corresponds to the 10^-4 dilution in both replicate A and B. 
		If replicate A and B were discordant then we would take the average value. 
		Total dilution of mouse #1 sample = 10^-4 * 1/2 (addition of sample to PBS, dilution plate 2) * 1/10 (addition of sample to vero cells) 
		Total dilution of mouse #1 sample = 5 x 10^-6 
		Toxin activity = Log10 (1/(5x 10^-6) =5.3 
		The limit of detection on this assay is 2.3
