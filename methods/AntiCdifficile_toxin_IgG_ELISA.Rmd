#Anti-C. difficile Toxin IgG ELISA
## Author: Jhansi Leslie 


###Background/Purpose  

Serum from mice (2013,2014, 2015 long term infection) infected with 630 and then re-challenged with VPI will be tested for levels of anti-toxin A antibodies (IgG).

###Validation of ELISA Protocol 
#### Checkerboard with positive and negative sera against antigen: determining optimal antigen coating concentration. Titrate antigen across plate against titration of mouse sera (positive).  Conjugate Ab is held constant. 
####Day 1: Coat Plate 
1.	Fill plate with 100uL of carbonate buffer per well (except columns 1 and 6)
2.	Use frozen aliquots of [toxin A] (https://www.listlabs.com/products/buy-toxin-a-from-clostridium-difficile) or [toxin B] (https://www.listlabs.com/products/buy-toxin-b-from-clostridium-difficile)
3.	Dilute toxin to desired concentration in carbonate buffer 

```
Calcs:
Toxin is stored 3ul at 1ug/ul – so I need 7 aliquots. Add  297 ul of carbonate buffer to the 3ul of toxin = 3ug/300ul or 1ug/100ul ⇒ 10ug/ml 
```
4.	Fill all the wells in column 1 with 200uL of diluted toxin per each well 
5.	Take 100uL from the wells in column 1 and move to column 2 – mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down 
6.	Repeat until you get to column 6 – move the 100uL in column 5 into column 7 and continue dilutions through column 11
7.	After mixing column 11, discard the extra 100uL in each  well
8.	Column 12 should be carbonate buffer alone
9.	For column 6 add 100ul of  separately diluted toxin 0.5ug/ml to each well 
10.	Incubate  overnight at 4C

####Day 2: Run Assay 
1.	Wash the plate 3x with PBST (PBS + 0.05% tween20) followed by 3x with PSB
2.	Block – add 100uL of 2% BSA(w/v) in PBST (blocking buffer) to each well,  Incubate for 1hr at 37C
3.	Wash the plate 3x with PBST (PBS + 0.05% tween20) followed by 3x with PSB
4.	Fill plate with 100uL of blocking buffer per well 
5.	Dilute the positive mouse sera (sera from infected mice) in blocking buffer to 1:12.5 
6.	Add 100μl of  1:12.5  diluted serum to wells in row A 1-12 - mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down  
	+	Row A should have 200uL per well
7.	Take 100uL from the wells in row A and move to row B- mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down  
8.	Repeat till you fill column G – after mixing row G, discard the extra 100uL in each  well
9.	Row H should be blocking buffer alone
10.	Incubate for 1hr at 37C
11.	Wash the plate 3x with PBST (PBS + 0.05% tween) followed by 3x with PSB
12.	Dilute conjugate Ab to1 /500
13.	Add 100uL of conjugate Ab per well
14.	Incubate for 1hr at 37C
15.	Remove substrate from fridge and let an aliquot equilibrate to room temp
16.	Wash the plate 3x with PBST (PBS + 0.05% tween) followed by 3x with PSB 
17.	Add 150 μL of substrate ABTS to each well
18.	Incubate at room temperature for 30min
19.	Add 100 μL of Stop solution (1% SDS)
20.	Measure absorbance at 410nm, measure background at 650nm

###Final ELISA Protocol 
	+ I only looked at Anti-toxin A IgG response 
####Step 1: Make up antigen solution/Coat plates (Protocol Day 1)
1.	Antigen = 100ug of toxin A 
	+	10 plates coated with A will be needed for each assay, thus 100ug of toxin will be needed 
2.	Make up 100mL of Bicarbonate-Carbonate buffer using tablets
3.	Filter sterilize
4.	Add 1mL of Bicarb buffer to each vial of 100ug of toxin 
	+	Invert to mix (don’t vortex)
5.	Combine the 1mL of toxin in Bicarb into a 250mL (autoclaved) glass bottle, then add 99mL of  Bicarb buffer
	+	= 100 mL of 1ug/mL toxin solution
6.	Pour the solution into a sterile reservoir; use a multichannel pipette to add 100uL of antigen solution into each well 
	+	Cover with parafilm and incubate o/n at 4C 
7.	Make all the toxin A plates at one time
 
#### Step 2: Measuring Serum IgG Anti-toxin A and B Antibodies  (Protocol Day 2)
```
 Samples: Day -2, 44 Serum from mice from 2013, 2014, 2015 experiments 
 Number of Plates: 10
 Negative control= coated wells + detection Ab & substrate (8 wells per each plate).  
 Positive control = starting dilution 1/5000 of mouse anti-toxin A IgG monoclonal anitbody  
 Notes: Dilute the sera to 1:400 (this is what was done on 2/24/13, and seems reasonable based on preliminary work done Nov 2013). Plates are coated with 1ug/mL toxin A from List biological labs. 
```
1.	Wash plate 3x with PBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween20) followed by 3x with PBS
2.	Block- add 200ul of 2% BSA (w/v) in PBST  (blocking buffer) to each well, incubate for 1hr at 37C
3.	Meanwhile, dilute sera in blocking buffer 
	+	Serum was saved in 10uL aliquots (so for 1:400 dilution add 2 ul of sera into 798 uL of blocking buffer)
	+	This gives you more than enough (need 400ul)
	+	Add 150uL of this into row A, remove 50uL add to 100uL of blocking buffer in row B – repeat until row G (1: dilutions).
4.	Wash plate 3x with PBST followed by 3x with PBS
5.	Add 100ul of diluted sera to wells of the plate 
6.	Incubate 1hr at 37C
7.	Meanwhile, dilute 2ndary Ab (Goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP) 1/500 in blocking buffer  (Cat# SouthernBiotech 1030-05)
8.	Wash the plate 3x with PBST followed by 3x with PBS
9.	Add 100uL of  2ndary Ab  to each well 
10.	Incubate 1hr at 37C
11.	Wash the plate 3x with PBST followed by 3x with PBS
12.	Add 150uL of substrate ABTS to each well
13.	Incubate at room temp for 30min
14.	Add 100ul of stop solution (1% SDS)
15.	Measure absorbance at 410nm
16.	Take background reading at 650nm
17.	The anti-toxin A IgG titer is defined as  the last dilution with an OD410 greater than mean absorbance of all negative wells on the plate plus 3 times the standard deviation from that mean.
