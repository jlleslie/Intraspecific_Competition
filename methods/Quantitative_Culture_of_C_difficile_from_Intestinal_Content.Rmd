#Quantitative Culture of *Clostridium difficile* from Intestinal Content
##Author: Jhansi Leslie


###Background/Purpose  
 *Clostridium difficile* is a Gram-postitive, spore-forming,  anaerobic bacterium that can colonize the gastrointestinal tract. 
 The use of selective agar containing the germinant taurocholate enables quantitation of both the vegetative and spore form of *C. difficile* from intestinal content.

6. [Sterile Reservoir](http://www.argos-tech.com/pipetting-reservoirs.html)
7. [Sterile 96-well plate] (https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/nunc-microwell-96-well-microplates/12565363)
8.  Pre-reduced [TCCFA or TCCFA supplemented with erythromycin] (https://github.com/jlleslie/Intraspecific_Competition/blob/master/methods/TCCFA_media.Rmd)
9. 1.5mL autoclaved eppendorf tube 
10. [Anaerobic chamber](http://www.coylab.com/vinyl.htm)
11. P-1000, 200, and 20 pipettes (our lab uses Rainin brand)
12. P-200 multichannel pipette   
  

Notes: All plates/media should be passed into the chamber at least 8 hours in advance to reduce. PBS should be reduced for at least 24 hours or alternatively autoclaved and then reduced for 8 hours. 
  
###Step 1: Collect feces/intestinal content from mouse 
1. Grasp mouse firmly & pick up, collect a fresh fecal pellet into a pre-weighed sterile 1.7mL eppendorf tube 
	+ Alternatively collect intestinal content during necropsy      

###Step 2: Determine the amount of sample in each tube 
1. Weight tube with stool in it, record the weight 
2. Determine how much PBS you need to add 

	
		(weight of tube+ stool) â€“ weight of tube  = grams of stool      
		grams of stool * 9000 = ul of sterile PBS to add to the tube
	

###Step 3: Dilute sample in PBS  (this is the 10^-1 dilution)
1. Pass the tubes into the anaerobic chamber along with any other materials you need
2. Add the correct volume of PBS to each tube (determined in step 2) 
3. Mix the PBS and sample by running the tube along a tube rack
	+ If the sample is stool and very solid then label your plates after adding PBS to allow time for the sample to loosen up. 

###Step 4: Set up the dilution plate, make further dilutions 
1. Open the reservoir (make sure not to touch it) and add PBS 
2. Using the multichannel add 135 uL of PBS to each well, of your 96-well dilution plate.
	+ Repeat for a total volume of 270uL per well. 
	+ Label the columns with the dilutions   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Starting at 10^-2 -> 10^-6)
	+ Label the rows with the sample ID (see plate template below)
	<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlleslie/Intraspecific_Competition/master/images/dilutions.jpg?token=AJ8FtpiZD45TskrMFiLNtx7kvkUmsQT5ks5Xm4pYwA%3D%3D" width="300" height="200" /></div>
3. Add your sample to the wells in column 1 or 8. 
	+ Add 30uL from your tube to the first column  (repeat with each sample, you can load 8 sample per side for a total of 16 samples per plate) 
		* Once the entire column is filled, use the multichannel to set to 30uL to mix by pipetting up and down.
		* Then move 30uL into the 2nd column mix and repeat until you get to the 10^-6 dilution. 

###Step 5: Label the TCCFA plates   
1. Write the sample name (e.g. Mouse 1) the dilution and media on each plate 
	+ TCCFA is a selective media. It limits the growth of some of the other bacteria in feces but not all of them, if you are working with an erythromycin resistant strain (eg. 630 or R20291) you can add 2 ug/mL erythromycin to the plates to limit background bacterial growth 

###Step 6: Add sample dilutions to TCCFA plates
1. Pipette 100uL of a given dilution on to a plate
2. Spread the solution around the plate with L-shaped spreader
	+ For each sample start with the lowest dilution (ie 10^-6) then you can use the same tip to add the next highest dilution 
	+ In the cefoperazone treated mouse model, mice are generally colonized with 1E7-1E8 CFU/g feces by 1 day post challenge, so we plate the following dilutions: 10^-4, 10^-5, 10^-6 
3. Incubate at 37C in the anaerobic chamber, agar side of the plate up.
	
###Step 7: Read plates and determine CFU/g feces 
1. Read plates 18-24 hours after plating 
2. *C. difficile* colonies on TCCFA +/- erythromycin are round, fringy, with a ground glass appearance.
3. Record the number of *C. difficile* colonies on each dilution plate 
	+ Ideally use the plates with between 30-300 colonies on them to determine CFU/g feces 

	
		    For example: if there were 61 colonies on Mouse #1's 10^-5 plate
		    61  X  1/10^-5  (dilution placed on plate) X 10 (plating dilution) = 6.1 x 10^7 CFU/g feces
