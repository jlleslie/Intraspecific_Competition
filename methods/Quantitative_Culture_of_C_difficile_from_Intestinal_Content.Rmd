#<center> Quantitative Culture of *Clostridium difficile* from Intestinal Content<center> 
##Protocol by: Jhansi Leslie


###Background/Purpose  
 *Clostridium difficile* is a Gram-postitive, spore-forming,  anaerobic bacterium that can colonize the gastrointestinal tract. 
 The use of selective agar containing the germinant taurocholate enables quantitation of both the vegetative and spore form of *C. difficile* from intestinal content.

5. Pre-reduced [PBS] (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10010049)
6. [Sterile Reservoir](http://www.argos-tech.com/pipetting-reservoirs.html)
7. [Sterile 96-well plate] (https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/nunc-microwell-96-well-microplates/12565363)
8. TCCFA or TCCFA supplemented with erythromycin 
9. 1.5mL autoclaved eppendorf tube 
10. Coy anaerobic chamber
11. 
   
###Step 1: Collect feces/intestinal content from mouse 
1. Grasp mouse firmly in hand to pick up the mouse, collect a fresh fecal pellet into a  pre-labeled sterile 1.7mL eppendorf tube 
⋅⋅⋅Alternatively collect intestinal content during necropsy.      

###Step 2: Determine the amount of sample in each tube 
2.	Weight tube with stool, record it 
3.	Determine how much PBS you need to add 

⋅⋅⋅(Tube+ stool) – Tube  = grams of stool 
⋅⋅⋅grams of stool * 9000 = ul of sterile PBS to add to the tube 

⋅⋅⋅4.	Pass the tubes into the chamber along with any other materials you need

###Step 2: Dilute sample in PBS  (this is the 10^-1 dilution)

4.	Add the correct volume of PBS to each tube (determined in step1) 
5.	Mix the PBS and sample by running the tube along a tube rack
..1.If the sample is stool and very solid then label your plates after adding PBS to allow time for the sample to loosen up.
