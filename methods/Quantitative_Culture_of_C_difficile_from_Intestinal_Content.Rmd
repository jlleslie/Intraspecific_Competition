#<center> Quantitative Culture of *Clostridium difficile* from Intestinal Content<center> 
##Protocol by: Jhansi Leslie


###Background/Purpose  
 *Clostridium difficile* is a Gram-postitive, spore-forming,  anaerobic bacterium that can colonize the gastrointestinal tract. 
 The use of selective agar containing the germinant taurocholate enables quantitation of both the vegetative and spore form of *C. difficile* from intestinal content.

4. [L-shaped cell spreaders] (https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/fisherbrand-l-shaped-cell-spreaders-2/p-4249846)
5. Pre-reduced [PBS] (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10010049)
6. [Sterile Reservoir](http://www.argos-tech.com/pipetting-reservoirs.html)
7. [Sterile 96-well plate] (https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/nunc-microwell-96-well-microplates/12565363)
8.  Pre-reduced TCCFA or TCCFA supplemented with erythromycin 
9. 1.5mL autoclaved eppendorf tube 
10. Coy anaerobic chamber
11. P-1000, 200, and 20 pipettes (our lab uses Rainin brand)
12. P-200 multichannel pipette 
   
###Step 1: Collect feces/intestinal content from mouse 
1. Grasp mouse firmly in hand to pick up the mouse, collect a fresh fecal pellet into a  pre-labeled sterile 1.7mL eppendorf tube 
⋅⋅⋅Alternatively collect intestinal content during necropsy.      

###Step 2: Determine the amount of sample in each tube 
2.	Weight tube with stool, record it 
3.	Determine how much PBS you need to add 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Tube+ stool) – Tube  = grams of stool 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grams of stool * 9000 = ul of sterile PBS to add to the tube 

4.	Pass the tubes into the chamber along with any other materials you need

###Step 3: Dilute sample in PBS  (this is the 10^-1 dilution)
5.	Add the correct volume of PBS to each tube (determined in step1) 
6.	Mix the PBS and sample by running the tube along a tube rack
	+ If the sample is stool and very solid then label your plates after adding PBS to allow time for the sample to loosen up. 

###Step 4: Set up your dilution plate, make further dilutions 
7.	Open the reservoir (make sure not to touch it) and add PBS 
8.	Using the multichannel add 135 uL of PBS to each well, of your 96-well dilution plate.
	+ Repeat for a total volume of 270uL per well. 
	+ Label the columns with the dilutions 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Starting at 10-2 -> 10-6)
	+ Label the rows with the sample ID (see template on next page)
8.	Add your sample to the wells in column 1 or 8. 
	+ Add 30uL from your tube to the first column  (repeat with each sample, you can load 8 sample per side for a total of 16 samples per plate) 
		* Once the entire column is filled, use the multichannel to set to 30uL to mix by pipetting up and down.
		*Then move 30uL into the 2nd column mix and repeat until you get to the 10-6 dilution.
