###Background/Purpose  
 *Clostridium difficile* is a Gram-postitive, spore-forming,  anaerobic bacterium that can colonize and cause disease in the gastrointestinal tract. 
It is believed that transmissive form of this bacterium is the [spore] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3434595/pdf/zii2704.pdf).
This protocol outlines how to make a semi-purified spore stock that can be used in subsequent animal experiments. Yield varies by strain but lab strains like VPI 10463, and R20291 typically result in stocks that are 1E8 spores/mL while strain 630 has much lower yields and typically requires pooling of multiple tubes.  



###Clospore recipe

For 1L:

+ 10g [Special Peptone Mix] (http://www.oxoid.com/UK/blue/prod_detail/prod_detail.asp?pr=LP0072)
+ 10g [Yeast Extract] (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/y1625?lang=en&region=US&gclid=CjwKEAjwiMe8BRD0ts3Vtv-ohWgSJAAZurk16RzuJBvQ8P9bmxPxM-fCh0W_yKBLqdZV1z3E4u3isBoCxVXw_wcB)
+ 0.6g [(NH4)2SO4] (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/a4418?lang=en&region=US)
+ 0.12g  [MgSO4 7H2O] (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigald/230391?lang=en&region=US)
+ 3.48g [K2CO3] (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigald/p5833?lang=en&region=US)
+ 2.6g [KH2PO4] (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/usp/1551139?lang=en&region=US)

Autoclave at liquid setting for 25 min

*All growth should be done in an anaerobic chamber, all broths need to be pre-reduced*  
###Protocol
1. Sub a single colony into 5mL of [Columbia broth](http://www.bd.com/ds/productCenter/294420.asp)
	+ As a control for possible contamination of your broth stock always incubate a broth only tube 
2. Incubate overnight at 37C in the chamber 
3. Inoculate 40mL of Clospore with the entire 5mL overnight culture
4. Allow to grow for >5 days, use a ~10uL to check for small phase bright particles (spores)
5. Remove tube from the chamber 
6. Centrifuge at 3200 rpm for 20 min at 4C
7. Discard supernatant in to 10% bleach solution (to disinfect) 
8. Add cold water with 0.05% Tween 20 and vortex to free any spores that have stuck to the tube during the growth. 
9. Repeat steps 6-7 at least 3 more times using  cold sterile water to wash  pellet rather than Tween water
10. After 4 washes in the big tube, transfer the pellet into a [1.5mL orange cap tube](https://catalog2.corning.com/LifeSciences/en-US/Shopping/ProductDetails.aspx?productid=430909(Lifesciences))
11. Wash 2 more times in this smaller tube 
12. Re-suspend pellet in 1.0mL sterile water, spores can be stored at room temperature short-term or at 4C for long-term storage. 


Notes: Vegetative *C. difficile* can be stored in glycerol stocks at -80C or spores can be stored in water at 4C
