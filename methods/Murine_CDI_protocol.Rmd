###Background/Purpose  
 *Clostridium difficile* is a Gram-postitive, spore-forming,  anaerobic bacterium that can colonize the gastrointestinal tract and cause diarrheal disease. 
This protocol outlines the steps I take when running  our lab's mouse model of CDI. 
Our lab utilizes both a 10 day antibiotic regime as well as a 5 day version. 
In most cases a 5 days is sufficient, however I started my experiments using a 10 day course so for consistency I have continued to use it. 

### Step 1: Determine the number of mice needed for the experiment 
1. Ideally the number of mice used in an experiment should be calculated based on the effect size of your phenotype.

**_Carry out step 2 if using mice from two different breeding colonies (such as 2 different genotypes).  Note in our hands co-housing doesn't completely homogenize the microbiota_** 
### Step 2: Co-house mice 
1. Ear punch mice *(alternatively, if you are not co-housing mice, ear hole punch mice when antibiotics are first administered)* 
	+   Maximum of 5 mice to one cage:		
		*	0 holes: mouse 1
		*	1 hole right ear: mouse 2
		*	2 holes right ear: mouse 3
		*	1 hole left ear: mouse 4
		*	2 holes left ear: mouse 5
2. Keeping in mind the age and gender of the mice, combine # 1-3 from genotype A with mice 4-5 from genotype B  and vice versa 
3. Co-house for 33 days from ~3 weeks of age, through antibiotic administration
4. Separate on day of infection

5. At completion of experiment use ear snips to [genotype  mice] (https://www2.jax.org/protocolsdb/f?p=116:5:0::NO:5:P5_MASTER_PROTOCOL_ID,P5_JRS_CODE:15966,002216)


### Step 3: Administer Antibiotics 
1. Add 0.5g of [cefoperazone] (http://www.mpbio.com/product.php?pid=02199695) into 1 L of [Gibco distilled water](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15230001)
2. Shake bottle to get the antibiotic into solution
	+ 1L of water should be enough for 5 cages of mice (200mL per cage)
3. At the mouse facility: 
	+ Remove lixits (make sure there are no leaks from the socket) 
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlleslie/Intraspecific_Competition/master/images/lixit.jpg?token=AJ8Ftn-dm0NMB6te8PYtPT8Ouo4gVo8sks5Xm416wA%3D%3D" width="150" height="100" /></div> 
	+ In a laminar flow hood pour antibiotic water into a sterile water bottle, then give the bottles to the mice
4. Add signage to cage signaling chemical hazard as appropriate.  
5. Replace water every other day (otherwise the antibiotic breaks down and smells bad, potentially preventing the mice from drinking it) 
6. After 10 days of antibiotic water, place mice on plain Gibco distilled water
7. Following 2 days off the antibiotic mice are ready for infection 

### Step 4: Prepare inoculum
1. On the day of infection, dilute [spores] (https://github.com/jlleslie/Intraspecific_Competition/blob/master/methods/Preparing_Cdifficile_spores.Rmd) to the desired concentration in Gbico water.  
2. After infecting mice, bring inoculum back to lab. 
3. Serially dilute and spread dilutions on plates containing taurocholate (like [TCCFA] (https://github.com/jlleslie/Intraspecific_Competition/blob/master/methods/TCCFA_media.Rmd)). 
4. The next day, count colonies to determine the number of spores given to each animal. 
	+ Note the inoculum needs to plated soon after being administered to animals as the spors will stick to the tube lowering the observed dose. 

### Step 5: Infect mice 
1. Mice are given spores by oral gavage.
	+ As with all animal work, great care and skill needs to be used in order to minimize harm to our animals. 
	+ Great resource for [how to gavage] (http://www.procedureswithcare.org.uk/oral-gavage-in-the-mouse/)
2. Typically mice are given between 10^3 to 10^5 spores in a total volume of 50-100uL depending on the experiment.
3. Mock infected mice are given an equal volume of plain water. 
4. Mice are weighted at time of infection to determine baseline weight. 
	+ Place [1000mL plastic beaker] (https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/fisherbrand-tri-cornered-polypropylene-beakers-6/14955111f) on a digital scale, zero the scale 
	+ Place a mouse in the beaker and record the weight
5. Between each manipulation use a [hydrogen peroxide based] (http://triple-s.com/pis/480/Perisept%20Technical%20Guide.pdf) disinfectant to kill spores. 
6. Frequent glove changes also helps to minimize spread of spores 
7. Label cages with biohazard stickers. 

### Step 6: Monitor mice 
1. Following infection, mice need to be monitored daily for signs of disease. 
	+	Signs include: 
		* Weight loss
		* Hunched/scruffy appearance 
		* Loose stool
		* Lethargy
3. We also collect stool for [quantitative culture of *C. difficile*] (), toxin activity and 16S rRNA gene 
2. Different strains of *C. difficile* elicit different clinical signs in this model. 
3. When mice get too sick (loose >= 20% weight, look very ill), euthanize and follow the rest of the collection protocol for harvesting samples. 

### Step 7: Serum collection (to monitor serum antibodies)   
1. Serum is collected throughout the experiment via saphenous vein puncture.
2. Mice are restrained in a 50mL conical with the end cut off for air.
3. The thigh of the mouse is shaved with a mustache trimmer. 
3. Vaseline is applied to the thigh, and a small gauge needle is used to puncture the vein.
4. The blood drops  are collected in [capillary blood collection tubes] https://www.sarstedt.com/en/products/diagnostic/capillary-blood/tubes/product/16444/) 
5. Following collection, the instruction for use provided with the tubes was followed, and serum was saved in the -80C. 
6. Serum was collected before antibiotics and throughout infection, approximately every 2 weeks. 

### Step 8: IP Clindamycin
1.	In the long-term infection model mice require a secondary antibiotic following six weeks of recovery from cefoperazone [Ref1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3225775/pdf/gmic0203_0145.pdf) [Ref2] (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4114)
2. To make mice susceptible again, we given them an IP of clindamycin 
	+ Open a sterile saline bottle in a BSC, remove 10mL
	+ add 10mg of clindamycin to the bottle, mix ([] = 1mg/mL)
	+ bring bottle with 1mL syringe to the animal room
	+ give mice 10mg/kg
	+ [IP injection resource] (http://www.procedureswithcare.org.uk/intraperitoneal-injection-in-the-mouse/) 
	
### Step 9: Necropsy
1. At the completion of the experiment, mice are humanely euthanized with CO2, using a flow meter to monitor the amount of gas being administered.
2. Following euthanasia, open up the mouse and remove the cecum and colon. 
3. Remove the intestinal content from both tissues using a sterile scalpel and save (snap freeze in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage). 
	+ Quantitative culture requires unfrozen sample  
	+ Toxin assay should be performed using frozen sample
