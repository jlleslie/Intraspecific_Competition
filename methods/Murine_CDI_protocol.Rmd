###Background/Purpose  
 *Clostridium difficile* is a Gram-postitive, spore-forming,  anaerobic bacterium that can colonize the gastrointestinal tract and cause diarrheal disease. 
This protocol outlines the steps I take when running  our lab's mouse model of CDI. 
Our lab utilizes both a 10 day antibiotic regime as well as a 5 day version. 
In most cases a 5 days is sufficient, however I started my experiments using a 10 day course so for consistency I have continued to use it. 

### Step 1: Determine the number of mice needed for the experiment 
1. Ideally the number of mice used in an experiment should be calculated based on the effect size of your phenotype.

** _Carry out step 2 if using mice from two different breeding colonies (such as 2 different genotypes).  Note in our hands co-housing doesn't completely homogenize the microbiota_** 
### Step 2: Co-house mice 
1. Ear punch mice *(alternatively, if you are not co-housing mice, ear hole punch mice when antibiotics are first administered)* 
	+   Maximum of 5 mice to one cage:		
		*	0 holes: mouse 1
		*	1 hole right ear: mouse 2
		*	2 holes right ear: mouse 3
		*	1 hole left ear: mouse 4
		*	2 holes left ear: mouse 5
2. Keeping in mind the age and gender of the mice, combine # 1-3 from genotype A with mice 4-5 from genotype B  and vice versa 
3. Co-house for 33 days from ~3 weeks of age, through antibiotic administration
4. Separate on day of infection

5. At completion of experiment use ear snips to [genotype  mice] (https://www2.jax.org/protocolsdb/f?p=116:5:0::NO:5:P5_MASTER_PROTOCOL_ID,P5_JRS_CODE:15966,002216)


### Step 3: Administer Antibiotics 
1. Add 0.5g of [cefoperazone] (http://www.mpbio.com/product.php?pid=02199695) into 1 L of [Gibco distilled water](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15230001)
2. Shake bottle to get the antibiotic into solution
	+ 1L of water should be enough for 5 cages of mice (200mL per cage)
3. At the mouse facility: 
	+ Remove lixits (make sure there are no leaks from the socket) 
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlleslie/Intraspecific_Competition/master/images/lixit.jpg?token=AJ8Ftn-dm0NMB6te8PYtPT8Ouo4gVo8sks5Xm416wA%3D%3D" width="150" height="100" /></div> 
	+ In a laminar flow hood pour antibiotic water into a sterile water bottle, then give the bottles to the mice
4. Add signage to cage signaling chemical hazard as appropriate.  
5. Replace water every other day (otherwise the antibiotic breaks down and smells bad, potentially preventing the mice from drinking it) 
6. After 10 days of antibiotic water, place mice on plain Gibco distilled water
7. Following 2 days off the antibiotic mice are ready for infection 

### Step 4: Prepare inoculum
1. On the day of infection, dilute [spores] (https://github.com/jlleslie/Intraspecific_Competition/blob/master/methods/Preparing_Cdifficile_spores.Rmd) to the desired concentration in Gbico water.  



1.	      Inoculate broth with single colony from TCCFA plate.

Day 7

1.	Make up Clindamycin (1 mg/ml) in saline, mice will get around 230 ul of this depending on their weight. Final dose is 10 mg/kg. 
2.	Take over 1 ml syringes and 27.5 gauge needles.  Make sure you mock infect your controls with saline if this is what you want to do. 
3.	Weigh animals before IP injection of Clindamycin.
4.	Grow up diluted C. difficile culture overnight in BHIS broth. 

Day 8 (subject to change)

1.	Prepare inoculum by getting accurate counts of CFUs going in. Need to be around 105 CFUs of C. difficile per mouse.  
2.	Need to wash o/n culture in PBS that has been equilibrated. 
3.	Use a Spec to check the OD600.  Can also use the hemocytometer. Gram-stain to make sure you have a pure culture.
4.	Plate out on TCCFA plates before you take inoculum out of chamber and after infecting mice, plate out again to see how many cells you lost.
5.	Fill syringes and make sure you cap them but not with needles. 
6.	Make a freezer stock of inoculum for â€“80C.
7.	Put in ziplock bags and then transfer out of chamber. Out in biohazard box to take over to BSRB for infection. You will need gavage needles.
8.	Weigh the mice before you gavage them to see if they lose weight on Clindamycin.
9.	If mock infecting, then use PBS to gavage the control group.


When mice get sick, euthanize and follow the rest of the collection protocol for harvesting samples.
