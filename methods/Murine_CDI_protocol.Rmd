###Background/Purpose  
 *Clostridium difficile* is a Gram-postitive, spore-forming,  anaerobic bacterium that can colonize the gastrointestinal tract and cause diarrheal disease. 
This protocol outlines the steps I take when running  our lab's mouse model of CDI. 
Our lab utilizes both a 10 day antibiotic regime as well as a 5 day version. 
In most cases a 5 days is sufficient, however I started my experiments using a 10 day course so for consistency I have continued to use it. 

### Step 1: Determine the number of mice needed for the experiment 
1. Ideally the number of mice used in an experiment should be calculated based on the effect size of your phenotype.

** _Carry out step 2 if using mice from two different breeding colonies (such as 2 different genotypes).  Note in our hands co-housing doesn't completely homogenize the microbiota_** 
### Step 2: Co-house mice 
1. Ear punch mice 
	+  5 mice max to one cage.		
	*	0 holes: mouse 1
	*	1 hole right ear: mouse 2
	*	2 holes right ear: mouse 3
	*	1 hole left ear: mouse 4
	*	2 holes left ear: mouse 5
2. Keeping in mind the age and gender of the mice, combine # 1-3 from genotype A with mice 4-5 from genotype B  and vice versa 
3. Co-house for 33 days from ~3 weeks of age, through antibiotic administration 
4. Separate on day of infection
5. At completion of experiment use ear snips to [genotype  mice] (https://www2.jax.org/protocolsdb/f?p=116:5:0::NO:5:P5_MASTER_PROTOCOL_ID,P5_JRS_CODE:15966,002216)


### Step 3: Administer Antibiotics 
1.	Add 0.5g of cefoperzone 
2.	Bring Anx water and blank over to BSRB
3.	Weigh mice and record.
4.	Start antibiotic water.  
5.	Check animals for the next 3 days.

Day 5

1.	Take animals off of Anx water and replace with regular water.
2.	Plate out C. difficile from the freezer on TCCFA agar plate and place in the 37C incubator in the anaerobic chamber. 

### Step 4: Prepare inoculum

### Step 5: Pre-pare inoculum  

1.	      Inoculate broth with single colony from TCCFA plate.

Day 7

1.	Make up Clindamycin (1 mg/ml) in saline, mice will get around 230 ul of this depending on their weight. Final dose is 10 mg/kg. 
2.	Take over 1 ml syringes and 27.5 gauge needles.  Make sure you mock infect your controls with saline if this is what you want to do. 
3.	Weigh animals before IP injection of Clindamycin.
4.	Grow up diluted C. difficile culture overnight in BHIS broth. 

Day 8 (subject to change)

1.	Prepare inoculum by getting accurate counts of CFUs going in. Need to be around 105 CFUs of C. difficile per mouse.  
2.	Need to wash o/n culture in PBS that has been equilibrated. 
3.	Use a Spec to check the OD600.  Can also use the hemocytometer. Gram-stain to make sure you have a pure culture.
4.	Plate out on TCCFA plates before you take inoculum out of chamber and after infecting mice, plate out again to see how many cells you lost.
5.	Fill syringes and make sure you cap them but not with needles. 
6.	Make a freezer stock of inoculum for â€“80C.
7.	Put in ziplock bags and then transfer out of chamber. Out in biohazard box to take over to BSRB for infection. You will need gavage needles.
8.	Weigh the mice before you gavage them to see if they lose weight on Clindamycin.
9.	If mock infecting, then use PBS to gavage the control group.

Day 9-13  (Start Vanco to treat)
	
1.	Monitor mice 2X a day to check for signs of sickness.
2.	Weigh them everyday. Sacrifice when they decrease below 20% from the weight the day of infection, not pre-antibiotic treatment.
3.	Collect feces every day for cytotoxicity assay and to plate out to see if C. difficile will grow.
4.	If you are looking at vancomycin for treatment purposes, you need to make vanco water (50mg/kg/day).  This comes out to 0.5 mg/ml of vancomycin.


Day 13
1.	Take off of vanco water and put on regular water. 
2.	Need to monitor and collect poop, and weigh everyday.

When mice get sick, euthanize and follow the rest of the collection protocol for harvesting samples.
