#Anti-C. difficile Toxin IgG ELISA
## Author: Jhansi Leslie 


###Background/Purpose  
 *Clostridium difficile* is a Gram-postitive, spore-forming,  anaerobic bacterium that can colonize the gastrointestinal tract and cause diarrheal disease. 
This protocol outlines the steps I take when running an ELISA detecting anti-toxin A IgG from infected mice. 
This protocol is based on many assays reported in the literature. 

###Validation of ELISA Protocol 
#### Checkerboard with positive and negative sera against antigen: determining optimal antigen coating concentration. Titrate antigen across plate against titration of mouse sera (positive).  Conjugate Ab is held constant. 
####Day 1: Coat Plate 
1.	Fill plate with 100uL of carbonate buffer per well (except columns 1 and 6)
2.	Use frozen aliquots of [toxin A] (https://www.listlabs.com/products/buy-toxin-a-from-clostridium-difficile) or [toxin B] (https://www.listlabs.com/products/buy-toxin-b-from-clostridium-difficile)
3.	Dilute toxin to desired concentration in carbonate buffer 

```
Calcs:
Toxin is stored 3ul at 1ug/ul – so I need 7 aliquots. Add  297 ul of carbonate buffer to the 3ul of toxin = 3ug/300ul or 1ug/100ul ⇒ 10ug/ml 
```
4.	Fill all the wells in column 1 with 200uL of diluted toxin per each well 
5.	Take 100uL from the wells in column 1 and move to column 2 – mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down 
6.	Repeat until you get to column 6 – move the 100uL in column 5 into column 7 and continue dilutions through column 11
7.	After mixing column 11, discard the extra 100uL in each  well
8.	Column 12 should be carbonate buffer alone
9.	For column 6 add 100ul of  separately diluted toxin 0.5ug/ml to each well 
10.	Incubate  overnight at 4C

####Day 2: Run Assay 
11.	Wash the plate 3x with PBST (PBS + 0.05% tween) followed by 3x with PSB
12.	Block – add 100uL of 2% BSA(w/v) in PBST (blocking buffer) to each well,  Incubate for 1hr at 37C
a.	Total blocking buffer 30mL
13.	Wash the plate 3x with PBST (PBS + 0.05% tween) followed by 3x with PSB
14.	Fill plate with 100uL of blocking buffer per well 
15.	Dilute the positive mouse sera (sera from infected mice) in blocking buffer to 1:12.5 
16.	Add 100μl of  1:12.5  diluted serum to wells in row A 1-12 - mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down  
a.	Row A should have 200uL per well
17.	Take 100uL from the wells in row A and move to row B- mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down  
18.	Repeat till you fill column G – after mixing row G, discard the extra 100uL in each  well
19.	Row H should be blocking buffer alone
20.	Incubate for 1hr at 37C
21.	Wash the plate 3x with PBST (PBS + 0.05% tween) followed by 3x with PSB
22.	Dilute conjugate Ab to1 /500
23.	Add 100uL of conjugate Ab per well
24.	Incubate for 1hr at 37C
25.	Remove substrate from fridge and let an aliquot equilibrate to room temp
26.	Wash the plate 3x with PBST (PBS + 0.05% tween) followed by 3x with PSB 
27.	Add 150 μL of substrate ABTS to each well
28.	Incubate at room temperature for 30min
29.	Add 100 μL of Stop solution (1% SDS)
30.	Measure absorbance at 410nm
